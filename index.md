Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find information about my recent works, my CV, and more.

## About Me

Greetings! I'm a 25-year-old, currently in my second year pursuing a Ph.D. at Seoul National University, under the guidance of Prof. Youngki Lee at [HCSLab](https://hcs.snu.ac.kr/). Prior to joining this lab, I spent my undergraduate years at Seoul National University and graduated as a Computer Science and Engineering B.S at 2022.

### Research Focus
My ultimate dream is to achieve seamless interaction between virtual and physical boundaries. Currently, my research orbits around two main projects. Firstly, I'm deeply engrossed in crafting intricate models that emulate realistic multi-modal interactions between virtual and physical entities, integrating elements like friction and mass into virtual settings for heightened realism. Secondly, I'm dedicated to revolutionizing low-intensity communication within mixed reality environments, facilitating users to blend their spaces with others' while retaining vital interaction nuances.


### Fun facts about me
- I spent a significant part of my childhood, precisely 12 years, soaking up the vibrant culture and rich experiences of Morocco.
- I love traveling! For the past 5 years, I've been to Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan), Switzerland (Bazel), France (Paris), New York, Mexico (Cancun). I'm planning on visiting Casablanca this year!

## Recent News
